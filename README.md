###### Betty
- Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks
###### Simple shell0.1
- Write a UNIX command line interpreter.
	- Usage: simple_shell
- Your Shell should:
	- Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
	- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
	- The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
	- The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
	- If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
	- Handle errors.
	- You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
- You don’t have to:
	- use the PATH
	- implement built-ins
	- handle special characters : ", ', `, \, *, &, #
	- be able to move the cursor
	- handle commands with arguments
- execve will be the core part of your Shell, don’t forget to pass the environ to it…
